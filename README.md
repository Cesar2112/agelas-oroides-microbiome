**Sponges** are ancient sessile animals inhabiting almost all aquatic ecosystems in our planet. Sponges are well known to produce bioactive compounds that can be produced by sponge itself, by their associated microorganism or by both. The concept of sponge holobiont gathers the host animal, its associated microorganisms and the biological processed occurring between this entities. Our objective is to describe the *Agelas oroides* holobiont by describing their cytological components and the microorganism associated with this specie. In the present repository we present the bioinformatic pipeline used to describe the microbial community associated to the sponge *Agelas oroides*.

**Figure 1.** *A. oroides* is a Mediterranean sponge inhabiting coraligenous formations to mesophotic depths (12-120 m).


## Sampling and metadata associated to analysis

6 specimens of *A. oroides* where collected in underwater semi-dark caves near Marseille. transported in plastic containers filled with sea water to the laboratory and placed in open system aquarium for 24hrs. One of the goals of the present study was to i) evaluate differences in microbiome composition between the body parts of the sponge: external, internal and the entire sponge.

In adittion we conduct a sponge cells / extracellular Prokaryote enrichement following two centrifugation forces as explained in the following schema:

in summary metadata for each speciment consisted a series of subsamples depending body parts *(Gnl:Entire sponge; Ext:External part;Int:Internal part; C1:Cellular fraction; C2:Extracellular bacterial fraction)*.
