**Sponges** are ancient sesile animals inhabiting almost all aquatic ecosystems in our planet. Sponges are well known to produce bioactive compounds that can be produced by sponge itself, by their associated microorngaims or by both. The concept of sponge holobiont gathers the host animal, its associated microorganisms and the biological processed occurring between this entities. Our objectif is tho describe the *Agelas oroides* holobiont by describing their cytological components and the microorganism assocaited with this specie. In the present study we  present the bioinformatic pipeline used to describe the microbial community associated to the spong *Agelas oroides*.

**Figure 1.** *A. oroides* is a Mediterranean sponge inhabiting coraligenous formations between 12-60 m depth.


## Sampling and metadata associated to analysis

6 specimens of *A. oroides* where collected in underwater semi-dark caves near Marseille. transported in plastic containers filled with sea water to the laboratori and placed in open system aquarium for 24hrs. On of the goals of the present study was to i) evaluate differences in microbiome composition between the body pars of the sponge: ectosome, endosome and the general body part.

In adittion we conduct a cells/ extracellular bacteria enrichement fractions following two centrifugation forces as explained in the following schema:

in summary metadata for each speciment consisted a series of subsamples depending body parts *(Gnl:General; Ect:ectosome;End:endosome; C1:Cellular fraction; C2:Extracellular bacterial fraction)*
